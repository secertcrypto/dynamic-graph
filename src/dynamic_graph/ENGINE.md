# Stateful dynamic graph computation on CrIS-MPC

This runtime implements Init, Insert and Iter on a fixed vertex set:
two NPH compute parties (0,1), and one preprocessing helper (2). Only
0/1 run RISA. Both retain local shares of the base DAG list, permutation
labels, vertex snapshot and delta-edge records. The helper follows the
public schedule, and receives no endpoint, message or vertex output shares.

## Build and try the public demo

Run from the CrIS-MPC repository root with local EMP populated:

```sh
cmake -S . -B build-local -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DCRIS_BUILD_RISA_READ=ON
cmake --build build-local --parallel 2 --target dynamic_graph_run dynamic_decode_test
ctest --test-dir build-local -R '^dynamic_' --output-on-failure
python3 src/dynamic_graph/check_iterations.py build-local/dynamic_graph/dynamic_graph_run --port 19500
```

The script launches three processes and checks each round against an independent
cleartext recurrence on public test data. To operate on separate input files:

```sh
# Generate public demonstration files in a NEW directory. The deterministic
# sharing is for this public fixture only.
python3 src/dynamic_graph/check_iterations.py --export demo-inputs
# Start each command in a separate terminal (or put them in the background).
./build-local/dynamic_graph/dynamic_graph_run 0 19500 demo-inputs/party-0.json p0.jsonl
./build-local/dynamic_graph/dynamic_graph_run 1 19500 demo-inputs/party-1.json p1.jsonl
./build-local/dynamic_graph/dynamic_graph_run 2 19500 demo-inputs/party-2.json p2.jsonl
```

Each output line reports the completed iteration count, active delta count
and **only that process's local vertex shares**. P2's vertex vector is empty.
The runtime has no output-opening step. Reconstruction by the test script is
outside the runtime. NPH uses the original directed ports base + 1024*i + j
(i=0,1,2; j=0,1). RISA uses a separate TCP channel at base+50. The launcher
uses localhost; the network configuration inherits NetNP's single peer-address
convention and the existing backend's channel/security assumptions.

## Input format and programming interface

Each party gets its own JSON file. Public keys are `vertices`, `base_edges`,
`max_delta`, optional `shift`, optional `application` (default `weighted_sum`),
and an ordered `rounds` array. Each round has `insert`: a list of new edges to
insert before executing the iteration. P0/P1 supply `base_rows` in vertex
order: the first V rows correspond to vertex IDs 0..V-1, source and destination
both that ID; subsequent rows are base edges in any order. Each row is
`[source_share, destination_share, data_share]`. Endpoint shares must be
canonical modulo V and the two shares must jointly encode a valid DAG list.
Vertex data are initial H; edge data are application inputs (weights).
Delta records have `id,src,dst,data`; P2 uses only each public `id` and does
not need `base_rows`. Participants must agree on dimensions, application,
operation order, delta IDs, scale and number of rounds. No malicious-input
validation of secret semantics is performed.

For C++ applications link `DynamicGraph::engine` and include
`dynamic_graph/engine.h`. Create the engine on all three processes:

```cpp
auto state = dynamic_graph::Engine::Init(config, local_base_dag, program);
// At a boundary between rounds:
state->Insert(public_handle, local_src_share, local_dst_share, local_edge_data);
state->Iter();
const auto& H_next_local = state->vertex_shares();
```

A duplicate handle or insertion beyond Dmax is rejected before compilation.
Parallel edges, self-loops and isolated vertices are allowed. The fixed base
graph never changes; insertion compiles only the new edge's states. A failed
interactive step invalidates the session; do not replay it with old masks.

## Protocol flow

1. **Init:** Securely reduce endpoint shares mod V and decompose them into
   secret key bits; run the existing stable MPC radix-sort to compute source
   and destination ranks. A public tie-break places vertex rows first for
   source groups and last for destination groups. If s,d are push labels,
   the three maps are s, the vector with sd[s[i]]=d[i], and the vector with
   dv[d[i]]=i. These maps and the source-aligned edge-data shares are computed
   once and retained. No endpoint is opened and there is no input owner with
   the entire graph. Initialize read parameters in Z_q and LWR update in Z_M.
2. **Insert:** Store an edge's data share and compile separate reusable
   read and update states at its source and destination, respectively.
3. **Iter:** Take the current H shares. Use Graphiti Propagate, MPC ApplyE and
   Gather for base edges. Read all delta sources from the *same* H via ReadBatch.
   Evaluate the same MPC ApplyE on each source share and edge-data share,
   encode the message shares, and use UpdateBatchGather in Z_M. Securely decode
   each summed delta coordinate **once**, add to the base aggregate, execute
   ApplyV once per vertex, save the local output shares into the first V rows,
   and advance the iteration counter. No future edge schedule is needed by
   the Engine API.

The base graph's secret sorting labels are reused. Because the original NPH
evaluator is a one-circuit runner, this implementation evaluates consecutive
MPC phases on a persistent network, with fresh triples, masks and PRGs each
time. It re-masks the cached transition labels with fresh shuffle groups when
building that round's Graphiti circuit; it does **not** re-sort the base DAG
or recompile old delta states. Account for this extra online/preprocessing
cost when comparing to the paper; this is not the paper's optimized persistent
shuffle representation. No raw share is passed to getOutputs(), which would
reconstruct it: phase boundaries retain only the local evaluator share.

## Exact decoding from approximate LWR updates

The current LWR payload is a uint64, so M=2^64 and q=2^(64-ell).
Use 1<=ell<=63 and S=2^ell>2*Dmax. Auto mode picks the smallest such scale;
a larger explicit shift is supported. Keeping q=2^64 while increasing M
would require a wider update primitive. Vertex values, weights and messages
are reduced modulo q. Read masking and outputs use that value width. The
unsigned local operation m<<ell implements S*m mod M, including modular wrap.

Each LWR update has coordinate error in {-1,0,1}. For a sum over active
edges, |eta|<=Dmax. Hence y=S*m+eta (mod M) decodes to m mod q since
0<=eta+S/2<S. This recovers exact message aggregates, conditioned on
underlying PIR/DPF/MPC correctness. The update primitive itself remains
approximate.

For shares y0,y1 first add S/2 to P0's share modulo M. Split each resulting
share wi=hi*S+loi locally. Inside MPC, calculate carry=1-LTZ(lo0+lo1-S) and
form hi0+hi1+carry. The comparison operand is in [-S,S-2] and fits signed
64-bit even when ell=63. The result modulo q is the desired logical right
shift. An overflow across the M boundary changes the high sum by q, which
vanishes modulo q. The low portions, carry and result are not reconstructed.
Independent right shifts on each share **without** this carry are incorrect.
There is no plaintext fallback.

## Applications, costs and verification scope

The default program uses m=h_src*w and H'=H+sum(m) in Z_q. `reachability`
sends a bit indicating a nonzero source and sets the next vertex bit iff it
was active or received a nonzero count. For this application we conservatively
require total base edges + Dmax < q so a positive count cannot wrap to zero.
Custom public deterministic ApplyE/ApplyV callbacks use RingOps (ring
arithmetic, zero test and signed-negative test). Arithmetic is evaluated in
Z_M and projected to Z_q; comparisons scale their input by S before using the
backend gates. Both graph paths use the same functions.

The implementation inherits the Spiral size bound and the cost of one cached
LWR state (~8 KiB per vertex per delta edge per compute party). Functional
tests are small-graph regressions, not a scalability benchmark or a formal
security proof. The secure-init implementation uses the existing MPC sort
rather than claiming a verbatim implementation/cost of the paper's Init.

Verification on the CrIS-MPC port: 144 secure decode boundary cases (including
ell=63 and ring wrap); independent share shifts without the carry would fail
60 cases. Four real three-process fixtures covered 13 successive rounds in
total, verifying every vertex against a cleartext oracle with **zero modular
error**. Cases included colliding delta destinations, insertion between rounds,
parallel/self edges, negative weights, q=16 overflow, an isolated single
vertex, no delta edges, and BFS propagation delayed until the next snapshot.
